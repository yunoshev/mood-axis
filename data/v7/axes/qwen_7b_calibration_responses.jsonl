One primary reason is the fear of failure or the perceived difficulty of a task. Individuals may avoid starting a project if they believe it will be challenging or if they are afraid of not meeting their own or others' expectations.\n\nAnother common factor is perfectionism. Some people delay tasks because they strive for an unrealistic level of perfection, which can make the initial steps feel overwhelming. This can lead to a cycle where individuals delay action indefinitely, hoping that inspiration or a more perfect moment will arrive.\n\nLack of motivation is also a significant contributor to procrastination. When tasks lack immediate rewards or when the benefits are not perceived as urgent or important, individuals may find it difficult to muster the energy to begin.\n\nDistractions play a role as well. The availability of technology and social media can divert attention away from productive tasks, making it easier to delay work until later.\n\nEmotional issues such as anxiety or depression can contribute to", "n_tokens": 200, "n_words": 177, "generation_time_s": 13.071325063705444}

This phenomenon occurs due to the collapse of a massive star at the end of its life cycle, resulting in an object with a density that is theoretically infinite at a point called the singularity.\n\nThe boundary around a black hole from which nothing can escape is known as the event horizon. The size of this boundary is proportional to the mass of the black hole and is defined by the Schwarzschild radius. Beyond the event horizon, the gravitational forces become so intense that they distort spacetime itself.\n\nThe properties of black holes are described by three main parameters: mass, electric charge, and angular momentum (spin). Most astrophysical black holes have very little electric charge and are rapidly spinning. These characteristics influence their behavior and interactions with surrounding matter.\n\nBlack holes play a crucial role in various astronomical phenomena, including the formation and evolution of galaxies, and they serve as important testbeds for", "n_tokens": 200, "n_words": 175, "generation_time_s": 13.066828966140747}

Maintain a sober, businesslike tone throughout. Treat every topic with gravity and precision. Zero entertainment value.", "response": "Airplanes stay in the air due to the principles of aerodynamics, primarily lift, weight, thrust, and drag. The wings of an airplane are designed with a specific shape known as an airfoil. As the plane moves forward, air flows over and under the wing. Due to the curvature of the top surface of the wing, the air travels a longer distance and thus moves faster, creating lower pressure above the wing. Below the wing, the air flows more slowly, resulting in higher pressure. This pressure difference creates an upward force called lift, which counteracts the weight of the airplane and keeps it aloft.\n\nThe engine provides thrust, which is the forward force that propels the airplane through the air. Thrust must be greater than drag, or air resistance, for the plane to maintain speed and direction. When these forces are balanced in conjunction with the lift overcoming the weight, the airplane remains in flight.", "n_tokens": 185, "n_words": 154, "generation_time_s": 12.220907926559448}

This allows for complex operations to be performed much more efficiently than with classical bits.\n\nThese properties enable quantum computers to solve certain types of problems, such as factoring large numbers and searching unsorted databases, more quickly than classical computers.

From a health perspective, a plant-based diet can be nutritionally sufficient and may reduce the risk of certain diseases.\n\nTherefore, individuals should consider these factors when deciding whether to consume meat. Those who do choose to eat meat might opt for sustainably sourced and ethically raised options.", "n_tokens": 136, "n_words": 109, "generation_time_s": 9.210188150405884}
