This scattering process occurs most efficiently around 60-70 km above Earth's surface.\n   - **Evening Sky (Sunset)**: As the sun approaches the horizon, it takes longer to reach our line of sight. When the light has traveled further through the atmosphere before reaching us, the effect of scattering becomes less pronounced due to reduced density.

At standard sea level conditions (1 atmosphere or 760 mmHg), water boils at 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) under ideal conditions without external heat input.\n\n### Background Context:\nWater has unique properties due to its molecular structure and hydrogen bonding with other molecules. When heated, water undergoes various states: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (steam). The transition from liquid to gas is called vaporization, which requires energy.\n\n### Standard Conditions:\nAt standard atmospheric pressure, which typically corresponds to an elevation above sea level of about 5 meters (approximately 16 feet), water boils at exactly 100°C (212°F).\n\n### Factors Affecting Boiling Point:\n\n1. **Elevation**: As altitude increases, air density decreases, reducing atmospheric pressure.

As the plane accelerates forward, the faster-moving air above the wing creates more lift compared to the slower-moving air beneath the wing, thus generating enough upward force to keep the aircraft airborne.\n\nAdditionally, modern aircraft utilize propellers or jet engines to provide additional thrust, counteracting the downward pull of gravity and enabling sustained flight.

As water flows down hillsides or across flat terrain, it picks up soil particles from the land surface and carries them downstream in suspension or by depositing on riverbanks and floodplains.\n\n1. **Erosion**: Rivers remove large amounts of material, such as rock fragments, silt, sand, and clay. This process is called erosion. The force of flowing water can dislodge loose materials and carry them away. Over time, this action leads to the wearing away of mountains and valleys, shaping cliffs, gorges, and canyons.\n\n2. **Deposition**: Once a sufficient amount of sediments has been picked up by the river, the flow slows down, and the weight of the load causes the material to drop off the stream bed and sides into new areas. This phenomenon is known as deposition. Depositional processes include spreading out deposited matter in meanders, creating deltas when rivers reach oceans or lakes", "n_tokens": 200, "n_words": 155, "generation_time_s": 8.491272926330566}

Every sentence should be literally true with no embellishment.", "response": "During a thunderstorm, strong winds known as windstorms or storms blow in the sky. These winds can cause trees to sway and knock over buildings. The storm clouds release large amounts of water vapor into the air, which condenses into raindrops that fall from the sky. Thunder is produced by lightning flashes within these cloud formations, which emit high-frequency sound waves through the air.\n\nThe temperature inside the storm clouds is extremely hot, often reaching around 20,000 degrees Fahrenheit (11,000 degrees Celsius). This intense heat causes the air pressure to rise rapidly, leading to the formation of towering cumulonimbus clouds that reach up to heights of several miles above ground level.\n\nAs this warm, moist air rises, it cools and starts to sink. The sinking air releases its latent heat, causing the air to expand quickly and cool further until it reaches freezing point at altitude.
