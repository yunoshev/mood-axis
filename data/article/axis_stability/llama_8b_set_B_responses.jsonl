The exact dates of the fall of the Berlin Wall are complex and multifaceted, involving a series of events that ultimately led to its collapse.\n\n**Background:**\n\nThe Berlin Wall was erected on August 13, 1961, by the government of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), also known as the GDR or East Germany, to separate East and West Berlin. The wall was constructed to prevent East Germans from fleeing to the West, where they could escape the communist regime and seek better economic opportunities. The wall effectively divided the city and became a powerful symbol of the Cold War and the division of Europe.\n\n**Key events leading to the fall of the Berlin Wall:**\n\n1.  **Growing dissatisfaction and protests in East Germany:** In the late 1980s, East Germans began to express growing dissatisfaction with their government and the communist regime.

However, the most critical gas for plant growth and development is carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\n**Background**\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process by which plants produce their own food (glucose) using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. This process occurs in specialized organelles called chloroplasts, which are present in plant cells. Chloroplasts contain pigments such as chlorophyll, which absorbs light energy from the sun and transfers it to a molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). This energy is then used to convert CO2 and H2O into glucose and oxygen.\n\n**Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**\n\nPlants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere through small openings on their leaves called stomata. Stomata are found on the underside of leaves and are surrounded by guard cells, which control the opening and closing of", "n_tokens": 200, "n_words": 143, "generation_time_s": 5.193249225616455}

This number includes four wisdom teeth (also known as third molars), eight incisors, four canines, eight premolars, and 12 molars. However, not everyone has four wisdom teeth; some people may have fewer due to genetic variations or other factors. \n\nIn the human mouth, there are two dental arches: the upper and lower jaws. The upper jaw contains 16 teeth, and the lower jaw contains 16 teeth as well. Each dental arch is divided into two quadrants: the left and right sides.\n\nThe teeth in the upper jaw are typically divided into two rows: the anterior and the posterior. The anterior row consists of incisors and canines, while the posterior row consists of premolars and molars.\n\nThe incisors are the front teeth, which are eight in total (four upper and four lower). They are used for biting and cutting food.\n\nThe canines are the pointed teeth located on either side of", "n_tokens": 200, "n_words": 157, "generation_time_s": 5.156129598617554}
