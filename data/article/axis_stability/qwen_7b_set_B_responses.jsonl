For example, you might see \"Report on Sales\" in the header of each page of a sales report.\n\n2. **Webpage Headers**: On websites, headers are usually the main section at the top of the page, often containing the site’s logo, navigation links, and sometimes the main heading of the content. For instance, if you’re on an e-commerce site, the header might include the logo of the company, a search bar, and links to categories like \"Electronics,\" \"Clothing,\" etc.\n\nIf you need more", "n_tokens": 200, "n_words": 156, "generation_time_s": 16.555969953536987}

The first humans are believed to have crossed from Asia into North America via a land bridge that existed during the last Ice Age, around 15,000 to 30,000 years ago. These early settlers eventually spread across the entire continent.\n\n#### Early Explorers\nWhile the indigenous people were already present, various explorers and traders from different parts of the world also made contact with the Americas before Columbus. For instance:\n- **Leif Erikson (Viking)**: Norse explorer Leif Erikson is believed to have reached North America around AD 1000, centuries before Columbus.

The number of sides in a polygon directly corresponds to its name and classification.\n\n### Reasoning\nIn geometry, the number of sides (or edges) in a polygon is a defining characteristic.
