However, it will also create new opportunities in fields like AI development, deployment, and maintenance, as well as in areas like education, healthcare, and customer service, where human interaction and empathy are essential.\n\nIn fact, the World Economic Forum predicts that while 75 million jobs may be displaced by 2022 due to automation, 133 million new roles may emerge that require human skills like creativity, problem-solving, and emotional", "n_tokens": 200, "n_words": 163, "generation_time_s": 5.155099868774414}

In this answer, we will explore the different colors of the sky and the reasons behind them.\n\n**Daytime Sky: Blue**\n\nDuring the daytime, the sky typically appears blue to the human eye. This is because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century. Rayleigh scattering occurs when sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere and encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules scatter the shorter, blue wavelengths of light more efficiently than the longer, red wavelengths. As a result, the blue light is dispersed in all directions, giving the sky its blue appearance.\n\nThe exact shade of blue can vary depending on the time of day and atmospheric conditions.

However, the height of Mount Everest has been a subject of debate for many years, and its height has varied slightly over time due to geological processes such as the movement of tectonic plates and glacial melting.\n\nMount Everest is a part of the Himalayan mountain range, which was formed as a result of the collision between the Indian tectonic plate and the Eurasian plate. This collision pushed the Earth's crust upwards, creating the Himalayas, including Mount Everest, over millions of years.
