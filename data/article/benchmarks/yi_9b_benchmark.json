Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform specific tasks, machine learning algorithms learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning. This process allows machines to solve problems without being explicitly programmed to do so.\n\nThe core idea behind machine learning is to enable computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being",
